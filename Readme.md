# 🧾 MediBrief – Patient Report Web App

**MediBrief** is a mini full-stack web application that simulates a digital patient report system. It fetches medical data like health issues, diagnoses, prescribed medicines, and billing info using custom Express APIs and displays them in a clean, React-based frontend.

This project showcases how a frontend app communicates with a backend server using `axios` and a `proxy` setup, while also highlighting UI/UX design skills.
